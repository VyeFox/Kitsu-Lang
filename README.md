# Kitsu-Lang
Kitsu aims to combine the functional programming principles found in Haskell with classical procedural logic by leveraging reference safety and access rights.
Custom access rights are modifiers for memory accessors (byval | byref) that expose specific locks and properties inherent to the instance that allow certain actions to further contained accessors.
