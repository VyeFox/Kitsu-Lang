# Kitsu-Lang
Kitsu aims to combine the functional programming principles found in Haskell with classical procedural logic by leveraging reference safety and access rights.
These access rights are specified by custom modifiers (alongside `mutable` and `const`) for use in C++ style (`const T &`) reference typing.
